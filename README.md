RSS autodownloader (for TorrentLeech)<br>
<br>
<p>This will work great for any system with wget installed as well as basic python3 (or 2) support. Could probably be customized for any kind of RSS feed and more specifically any torrent RSS feed. Provided TorrentLeech don't have any weird habits it should already be good for torrent RSS.</p>
<p>Regardless, I'm not going out of my way to really make this much better. Once it has interval support (only match items in a certain interval) it'll be done as far as I'm concerned.</p>
